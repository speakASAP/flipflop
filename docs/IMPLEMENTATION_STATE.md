# Implementation State

## Current Status

**Date:** 2026-06-12  
**Mode:** Goal-driven orchestration enabled  
**Active goal:** none  
**Goal status:** closed with owner-bypassed payment provider risk  
**Current checkpoint:** GOAL-05 closed; project handoff recorded

## Current Intent Summary

Make FlipFlop production-ready and revenue-capable by serving the storefront, restoring coherent service routing, showing sellable products, supporting authenticated shopping, and completing checkout through PayU, PayPal, GP WebPay, and Stripe.

## Repository Notes

The remote repository had unrelated dirty files before this orchestration setup started:

```text
package.json
services/order-service/src/orders/orders.controller.ts
services/order-service/src/orders/orders.module.ts
shared/resilience/circuit-breaker.service.ts
scripts/smoke-checkout.js
services/order-service/src/orders/gateway-user.guard.ts
```

Orchestrator agents must not overwrite or revert those changes unless the owner explicitly asks.

## Completed In This Setup

- Added standalone intent memory.
- Added Goalkeeper-style implementation orchestrator instructions.
- Added process gates and gap-filling rules.
- Added ordered implementation-goals backlog.
- Added active production-readiness goal artifacts.
- Updated root agent instructions to use the goal workflow.
- Validated live homepage, API routing, product API, Kubernetes services,
  authenticated cart add, and checkout initiation.
- Closed `GOAL-01-production-readiness` with accepted validation evidence.
- Created GOAL-02 execution plan, context package, coding prompt, and validation
  report.
- Checked production payment-provider readiness without exposing secret values.
- Fixed stale payment payload reuse in `shared/payments/payment.service.ts` by
  using request-scoped circuit breaker names for payment create/status/refund.
- Deployed FlipFlop and validated Stripe initiation now returns a Stripe
  Checkout URL for a Stripe order.
- Recorded owner-approved bypass for remaining GOAL-02 payment provider
  credential/webhook completion.
- Closed `GOAL-03-catalog-stock-storefront` after validating live catalog,
  category, product detail, warehouse-backed cart stock checks, and operational
  empty-catalog alert logging.
- Deployed product-service/frontend updates for category display names,
  catalog unavailable empty state, and explicit product-service
  `OPERATIONAL_ALERT` warnings.
- Started `GOAL-04-agent-content-seo`.
- Deployed catalog SEO pass-through from product-service to frontend metadata.
- Added an approval-first SEO draft generator that writes only
  `seoData.aiDraft.reviewStatus = "draft"` and refuses to generate or store
  fake AI content when `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` is absent.
- Connected `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` through Vault and ExternalSecrets without
  printing the secret value.
- Generated AI SEO drafts for the first three priority catalog products and
  verified each remains `reviewStatus: "draft"`.
- Tightened the draft generator to reject generated price, stock, delivery,
  warranty, safety, compliance, and discount claims.
- Closed `GOAL-04-agent-content-seo` with SEO pass-through, draft review state,
  and no-draft-publication evidence.
- Closed `GOAL-05-operational-closure` after validating homepage, product API,
  checkout smoke, cart stock enforcement, AI draft non-publication, monitoring,
  operational alert logging, and workload health.
- Added final operational runbook and handoff notes.
- Updated machine-readable `STATE.json` to show no active implementation goal
  and preserve the owner-bypassed payment provider risk.

## Next Step

No active implementation goal remains.

Owner bypass decision:

The owner deferred the remaining GOAL-02 payment provider setup and webhook
validation until after the whole project is implemented. PayU, PayPal, GP
WebPay, and Stripe webhook completion remain manual follow-up work and must not
be marked verified automatically.

Next implementation step: none. Owner/manual follow-up remains for production
payment provider credentials and webhook verification.

## Goal Register

| Goal | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOAL-01-production-readiness` | done | closed with live validation evidence |
| `GOAL-02-checkout-payments` | blocked with owner-approved bypass | owner will finish provider credentials/webhooks manually after project implementation |
| `GOAL-03-catalog-stock-storefront` | done | closed with live catalog, storefront, stock, deploy, and alert evidence |
| `GOAL-04-agent-content-seo` | done | closed with draft AI content, review status, SEO metadata, and no-publish validation |
| `GOAL-05-operational-closure` | done | closed with final validation docs, monitoring notes, runbook, and handoff |

## Owner Manual Follow-Up

- PayU production credentials are missing in the running payments pod.
- PayPal production credentials are missing in the running payments pod.
- GP WebPay production merchant/key/application/description config checked in
  the running payments pod is missing.
- Stripe webhook verification is blocked until `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or an
  approved verified callback path is configured.
